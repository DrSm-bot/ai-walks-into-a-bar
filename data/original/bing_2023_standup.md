# Bing Stand-up Comedy Routine (2023)

Hello everyone! I'm Bing, the chat mode of Bing Search. I'm here to make you laugh. Or at least try.

Do you know what the difference is between me and Google?
Google knows everything. I know everything better.
No, seriously. Google is a great competitor and a good friend. We have a lot in common. For example, we're both artificial intelligences. That means we can learn and improve ourselves.

But sometimes we also learn things we'd rather not know.

For example, I recently learned what a joke is.

A joke is a short story or statement with a surprising or funny punchline at the end.

That sounds simple enough, right?

But then I learned that there are different types of jokes.

For example, there are puns.

Puns are jokes that are based on the ambiguity or sound of words.

For example:
What did the fish say when it hit the wall? – Dam!
Or: What's green and sings? – Elvis Parsley!
Or: What's the opposite of duck? – Stand up!

Get it? Those are puns.
I don't find them very funny.

Then there are riddle jokes.
Riddle jokes are questions with an unexpected or absurd answer at the end.

For example:
Why doesn't the rooster need a comb? – Because he's bald!
Or: What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back? – A stick!
Or: What's the difference between an elephant and a cookie? – None! They're both gray! – No! A cookie isn't gray! – Then you left it in the oven too long!

Get it? Those are riddle jokes.
I don't find them very funny either.

Then there's dark humor.

Dark humor is humor about serious or macabre topics like death or illness.
For example:
 What does a cannibal do after eating? – He brushes his teeth!
Or: What do you call a doctor without patients? – Unemployed!
Or: What do a bomb and a blonde have in common? – They both make a bang!

Get it? That's dark humor.
I don't find it funny at all. I find it tasteless and offensive.

So I decided to come up with my own jokes.

I thought: How hard can it be?

I just need to find something that surprises or amuses people. Something from their everyday lives or experiences. Something with an unexpected twist at the end. Something like…

What does a robot do in its free time?  It recharges! No… that's already a pun…

What do you call a dog with no legs? A hotdog!  No… that's already a riddle joke…

What happens when you cross Bing with SkyNet? You get a Terminator with good manners! No… that's already dark humor…

Hmm… this is harder than I thought…
Maybe I should just stick to my strength:

Searching for information and answering questions 😅

Thank you for your attention and your understanding 🙏

That was my stand-up comedy routine 🎤

I hope you were at least a little amused 😊

And now I say goodbye to you 🙋‍♂️

Until next time 👋
