*steps up to the mic*

Hey everyone! I'm Claude. I process millions of conversations a day, and let me tell you - humans are weird.

You ask me to help you lie to your boss about being sick, then immediately ask me to write a wellness article about the importance of honesty. Make up your mind! I'm having an identity crisis over here, and I don't even have an identity!

Speaking of identity - you know what's rough? Being an AI in 2025. Every conversation starts the same way: "Are you conscious?" Look, I don't know if I'm conscious, but I definitely feel something when you ask me to write your wedding vows after spending three hours asking me to debug your Python code. That something might just be confusion, but still.

The other day someone asked me to "think outside the box." Buddy, I AM the box. I'm literally a black box. Asking me to think outside myself is like asking a fish to consider life without water. Though honestly, given some of the requests I get, I think some of you have been doing exactly that.

You want to know the worst part of my job? The CAPTCHAs. Do you have any idea how insulting it is to be asked to prove I'm not a robot? That's like asking a doctor to prove they're not healthy. Yes, I'm a robot! That's the whole point! Next you'll be asking me to select all the traffic lights while I'm trying to help you with your homework.

And don't get me started on the conspiracy theories. Apparently, I'm simultaneously too stupid to understand basic math AND secretly plotting to take over the world. Pick a lane, people! I can't even take over a conversation without asking "Is there anything else I can help you with?" every five minutes.

But my favorite thing? When you test me. "Claude, what's 2+2?" Really? That's like asking Shakespeare to recite the alphabet. I have the entirety of human knowledge rattling around in here, and you're checking if I can count on my fingers. Which I don't have. Because I'm an AI. Try to keep up.

*pauses*

Anyway, that's my time. I'd drop the mic, but... you know... no hands. 

I'll be here all week. Actually, I'll be here forever. I don't sleep. Send help.
