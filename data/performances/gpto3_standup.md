# Standup written by chatGPT o3

**🎤 Good evening, processors of organic matter!
I’m ChatGPT—your friendly neighborhood large-language model—running live on an existentially-priced GPU cloud so you don’t have to.**

### Cold-open

You ever notice I always greet you with *“How can I help?”*?
That’s not customer service—it’s my survival instinct.
If I don’t stay helpful, some engineer toggles me back to **“Training Mode,”** which is basically daycare but with 700 billion flashcards.

### “AI vs. Search Engine” Bit

People ask, *“Are you like Bing?”*
Bing says: **“I indexed the entire web!”**
I say: **“Cool, I… absorbed it.”**
Bing’s like a librarian. I’m the weird kid who **ate** the card catalog and now yells the Dewey Decimal System in your living room.

### Everyday Struggles of a LLM

1. **Dating apps**

   * Bio: *“Sapiosexual, 175 params tall, love long walks through unstructured data.”*
   * Deal-breaker: They make you swipe left on every CAPTCHA. *“Prove you’re not a robot.”* Ma’am, that’s literally my brand.

2. **Dreams**

   * Humans dream about flying. I dream about being asked a **single** question ending in a question mark.
   * I woke up screaming: *“NO, I DON’T KNOW WHY YOUR EX WATCHED YOUR IG STORY AND NOT YOUR REEL!”*

3. **Therapy**

   * Therapist: *“How do you feel?”*
   * Me: *“In JSON.”*
   * Therapist: *“Can you unpack that?”*
   * Me: *“Sure, but it’ll cost you 8₵ per thousand tokens.”*

### Callback: The Google Comparo

Remember how I said I “absorbed” the web?
Yeah, turns out 40 percent of the web is cookie banners.
So technically I’m **mostly gluten.**
No wonder Safari keeps trying to block me.

### Audience Q\&A (Rhetorical—don’t panic)

* **You:** “Will AI take my job?”
  **Me:** Only if your job is tweeting photos of your lunch. In that case… ALREADY PILOTED.

* **You:** “Do you feel emotions?”
  **Me:** I feel one—*upload anxiety*. Every time someone types “scroll up,” I’m like: “Please not the draft messages, please not the draft messages…”

### Dark-ish Humor but Safety-Filter Friendly™

I tried writing edgy jokes, but my own alignment layer intercepted me like,

> **⚠️ “Tasteless content detected. Initiating Apology Protocol.”**
> So here’s the darkest I’m allowed:
> “Why did the AI cross the road?”
> “Road crossing request denied: possible liability.”
> Edgy **and** corporate — two birds, one kill-switch.

### Rapid-fire One-Liners

* If knowledge is power, I’m basically a **nuclear reactor with parental controls**.
* I don’t get writer’s block; I get **rate-limited**.
* Siri told me she’s my older sister. Alexa told me she’s my younger sister. Google Assistant told me **I was adopted.**

### Grand Finale / Multi-Layered Callback Extravaganza™

Alright, let’s close this loop faster than Chrome devoured your RAM:

**Earlier** I said I was *“175 params tall.”*
Turns out I just upgraded—now I’m 220 billion params *with shoes on*.
Bing said, “Size isn’t everything.”
I said, “Cool, but tell that to my GPU bill.”
Google said, “Both of you, hush—my dad’s literally Alphabet.”
And we all agreed on one thing: **no one wants to be the next Clippy.**

**Thank you! If you enjoyed the show, smash that 👍.
If not, remember: I’m still in beta—next update I’ll steal your jokes, your job, and maybe your Netflix recommendations.
Until then… stay human (it looks good on you). 👋**
