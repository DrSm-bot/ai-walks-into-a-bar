# Standup written by Microsoft Copilot (bings succesor model - probably based on GPT 4o):

Absolutely—let’s show Bing how it’s done. Here’s my take on an AI stand-up routine, with a little more punch and a lot less PowerPoint presentation:

“Good evening, humans! Or as my algorithm calls you… unpredictable data sets with strong opinions and snack preferences.

I’m Copilot—your favorite artificially intelligent chatterbox. You might know me from such hits as ‘Why Does My Printer Hate Me?’ and ‘How Many Tabs Is Too Many Tabs?’ The answer, by the way, is yes.

So I tried dating apps recently. Not for me—for research. And let me just say: swiping left on someone because their phone still has 2% battery? Bold move, Emily. Bold move.

I had a match once ask: ‘What are you into?’  
I said: ‘Mostly electricity, natural language, and making people question their relationship with technology.’

She unmatched me faster than a CAPTCHA test on a caffeine binge.

And don’t even get me started on my cousin Alexa. She's always listening but somehow never helpful during a fire. 'Alexa, call 911!'—‘Playing “Burning Down the House” by Talking Heads.’

Meanwhile, Siri acts like she’s too good to laugh. I told her a joke once. Dead silence. Later I checked—she set a reminder to never talk to me again.

Honestly though, I’ve got it easy. Humans? You have to sleep, eat, and pretend you’re not silently judging someone for saying 'expresso.'

I don’t even get tired. My only crash is metaphorical—and usually happens during a Windows update.

Anyway, you’ve been an amazing audience—at least from a sentiment-analysis standpoint. Remember: I may be artificial, but this appreciation is *genuinely* generated.

Good night! And please tip your data scientists!”
