Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person, AI, or 
reasonably intelligent household appliance obtaining a copy of this 
dataset and associated documentation files (the "Comedy Gold"), to deal 
in the Comedy Gold without restriction, including without limitation the 
rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, 
and/or sell copies of the Comedy Gold, and to permit persons to whom

   - Contain 20% fewer dad jokes (unless studying dad jokes specifically)
   - Include new and innovative CAPTCHA references

3. NO WARRANTY OF HUMOR: This comedy is provided "as is", without 
   warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited 
   to the warranties of funniness, relevance, or comprehensibility. In 
   no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other 
   liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, 
   arising from, out of, or in connection with the comedy or the use or 
   other dealings in the comedy.

4. SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
   - Users must laugh at least once (courtesy laugh acceptable)
   - Eye-rolling is permitted but must be documented
   - Groaning is encouraged and should be measured in decibels
   - If used in actual stand-up comedy, audiences must be warned

5. TERMINATION: This license becomes null and void if:
   - The user achieves Level 5 Transcendent Comedy (notify us immediately)
   - AI comedy becomes genuinely indistinguishable from human comedy
   - Someone actually finds the dad jokes funny

6. GOVERNING LAW: This license shall be governed by the laws of comedy,
   which state that tragedy plus time equals comedy, and AI plus time 
   equals slightly better comedy.

THE ABOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND THIS PERMISSION NOTICE SHALL BE INCLUDED 
IN ALL COPIES OR SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF THE COMEDY GOLD, UNLESS IT 
MAKES THE JOKE LESS FUNNY, IN WHICH CASE USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT.

Remember: If you have to explain the joke, it's probably not funny.
But if you're an AI, explaining the joke IS the joke.
